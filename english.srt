1
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:19,290
That's...

2
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,910
How interesting.

3
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:32,740
Grandfather?

4
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:37,620
That last psychokinetic blast
came from the 3H, didn't it?

5
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:43,450
I've never heard of anyone developing
robots that could use psychic powers.

6
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:48,330
Neither have I... I don't believe
it's possible for current technology.

7
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:52,660
I shouldn't think so.
Which would mean...

8
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:58,950
a nonmachine element resides in that 3H.

9
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:02,620
So, the demon has inhabited
the robot, has it?

10
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:08,240
I've received reports about the parasites,
but I didn't hear anything about this.

11
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:11,450
We haven't received reports of it, either.

12
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:14,120
I've only heard about it
through personal conversations.

13
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:16,240
No, no.

14
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:19,740
I wasn't criticizing you, Kyouko.
I was just thinking about...

15
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:22,410
how fascinating it was.

16
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:29,160
To think that you could use
a humanoid robot this way...

17
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:09,370
This isn't good, though.

18
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:13,290
That psychic display
must've been seen.

19
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:16,240
The police will be upon us presently.

20
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:19,330
Brother, should we leave here
for the time being?

21
00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:20,740
Yeah.

22
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:22,540
Tatsuya!

23
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:24,490
Sorry! We're late!

24
00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:27,450
Good timing.

25
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:29,580
Leo, you came, too?

26
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:34,240
Yeah. I got them to let me tag along.
Partly for rehab.

27
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,580
Well, don't overdo it.

28
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:36,790
Right.

29
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:38,240
Erika...

30
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,620
What?

31
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:42,910
We need to leave this place
as quickly as possible.

32
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:46,160
Did you prepare a way
to carry the three of them?

33
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:49,870
Um... We can take them to the storehouse
at Miki's place. Is that okay?

34
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:52,240
Is that okay, Mikihiko?

35
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,620
Of course it is.

36
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:58,290
I mean, that was our job
as Ancient Magic users to begin with.

37
00:03:58,290 --> 00:04:02,300
All right, then me, Miki,
and I guess Leo, will take over here.

38
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:02,700
You guess?

39
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:05,410
You three should go home.

40
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:08,950
Wait, why?
We'll wait for you to load up.

41
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:12,410
Tatsuya, well, that is...

42
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:21,950
We'll take a cabinet.

43
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:23,990
I think that would be best.

44
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,990
Brother, whatever might you
be worried about?

45
00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:39,870
It's not that I'm worried, really, it's just...

46
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:45,370
Honoka, when Pixie released
that powerful psychokinetic blast earlier...

47
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:48,200
did you get a sense of what happened?

48
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:51,540
No, why? What do you mean?

49
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:54,240
I'd like you to listen calmly.

50
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,700
Just before Pixie fired the psychic blast,

51
00:04:56,700 --> 00:05:00,240
she'd been supplied
with Psions from you, Honoka.

52
00:05:03,450 --> 00:05:07,410
Do you mean to say
that Honoka provided Pixie with strength?

53
00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:10,870
No, it didn't exactly seem like that.

54
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:12,910
It was similar to the process

55
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:17,450
of injecting Psions into a CAD
when you want to expand an activation sequence.

56
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:21,040
Something like priming.

57
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:24,200
Or maybe resonance.

58
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:28,790
Mizuki said something
like the parasite copied Honoka's thoughts.

59
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:33,790
There really seems to be
some sort of path between Honoka and Pixie.

60
00:05:33,790 --> 00:05:36,290
And it seems like...

61
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:45,700
It seems like the medium for it
is your hair ornaments, Honoka.

62
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:49,870
Specifically, those crystals.

63
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:54,290
I don't have any idea
what sort of logic is at work here, but...

64
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:13,370
Tatsuya gave me
these precious hair ornaments!

65
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:15,240
I don't want to lose them!

66
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:20,450
Setting aside the operative
principles for now...

67
00:06:20,450 --> 00:06:23,240
we'll have to find a way to control it.

68
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:33,080
Well, how are we going to carry these guys?

69
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:36,330
I'll call a car. That'll work, right?

70
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:38,910
You there, what are you doing?

71
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:49,240
You're all in high school, aren't you?
What are you doing here at this hour?

72
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:51,410
What is this?

73
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:53,660
What the hell were you doing?

74
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:56,620
No, well, you see--

75
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:59,290
I should be asking you. Who are you?

76
00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:00,270
What was that?

77
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:01,660
Hey, Erika...

78
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:06,200
Didn't you hear me?
I asked your names and rank.

79
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,540
What, you don't know?

80
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:10,330
There aren't any policemen
in this area right now.

81
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:12,830
They were ordered to leave.

82
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:16,410
Even that stupid brother of mine
wouldn't cut corners at a time like this.

83
00:07:16,410 --> 00:07:18,290
What are you jabbering about?

84
00:07:18,290 --> 00:07:21,540
You should've pretended to be detectives
in civilian clothing to better disguise yourselves.

85
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:24,120
Then, I would've at least heard you out.

86
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:27,540
You know you can't get out of this
with that nonsense!

87
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:30,620
We've caught you committing
a violent crime! You're coming with us!

88
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:34,080
Really? You're still
going to play the fool, huh?

89
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,200
That's too bad for you.

90
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:40,700
We stopped these three
during an attempted sexual assault.

91
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:44,950
And we were just waiting
for actual police officers to get here.

92
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:49,910
This is no place for imitations.
Am I making myself clear here?

93
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:52,950
I'm impressed how she can spin a story
off the top of her head.

94
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:54,540
Mikihiko!

95
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:05,580
Leo, get back!

96
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:20,040
They make those?

97
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:45,950
Thunder Child!

98
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:50,080
Where are Leo and Erika?

99
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:18,490
We're being pulled away
from the parasites.

100
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:23,790
We have to finish this quickly
even if it means being somewhat forceful.

101
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:25,580
Get down!

102
00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:53,740
I'll get 'em!

103
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:56,330
Don't, Erika!

104
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:59,830
If you shot them out of the sky here,
it would cause a massive tragedy.

105
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:04,160
Well, that throws a wrench into things.

106
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:09,290
A call is coming in from the stealth team.

107
00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:11,240
Open the line.

108
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:15,990
Reporting in. The mission was a success.
Sample secured.

109
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:20,740
Despite the accident,
you seem to have accomplished your objective.

110
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:23,370
Bring them into the ice box as planned.

111
00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:26,290
And go heavy on the drugs just in case.

112
00:10:26,290 --> 00:10:27,490
Yes, sir!

113
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:31,080
VISITOR ARC IX

114
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:34,150
FEBRUARY 17, 2096

115
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:39,990
You had something to talk about?

116
00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:45,290
Tatsuya, well, actually...

117
00:10:45,290 --> 00:10:48,870
What, did you let the parasites
get away or something?

118
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:54,370
I'm not going to get mad
at something like that, so stop worrying.

119
00:10:54,370 --> 00:10:56,700
We can't do anything about them
now that they got away.

120
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:58,580
No, that's not it, Tatsuya!

121
00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:02,040
That's right! They didn't escape!

122
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:06,120
Well, I mean, I guess they did, but...

123
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:10,740
Someone swooped in and grabbed 'em.

124
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:13,450
They were that strong?

125
00:11:13,450 --> 00:11:16,040
It may sound like we're being sore losers,

126
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:19,410
but I don't think they were really that strong
in terms of their abilities.

127
00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:19,900
Right.

128
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:22,330
But they came fully armed.

129
00:11:22,330 --> 00:11:25,700
I've never seen a suit that shocked you
whenever you punched it before.

130
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:28,870
Every time I hit it,
this powder sprayed everywhere!

131
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:33,620
I should've brought a weapon
with more reach!

132
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:34,990
I see.

133
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:38,790
And then the parasites got taken away
on a black airship.

134
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:40,790
It makes me so mad!

135
00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:44,120
Well, I'm glad nothing worse happened.

136
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:47,120
Tatsuya, you know who they were?

137
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,330
Yeah.

138
00:11:48,330 --> 00:11:54,160
If they used such interesting gear
and a stealth-equipped airship...

139
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:58,910
it has to be the Japan Ground Defense Force's
counterintelligence Section Three.

140
00:11:58,910 --> 00:12:03,700
If we know who we're up against, don't we
know where they brought the parasites to?

141
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:06,620
We can't narrow it down
if we don't know what they're after.

142
00:12:07,950 --> 00:12:09,740
Right.

143
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:13,950
They're a government agency, so they can
probably have as many bases as they need.

144
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:16,540
Well, they've got a budget.

145
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:18,870
They can't just have a hundred.

146
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:24,660
But they're probably hidden all over the place,
so well even a thorough search wouldn't work.

147
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:27,870
Well, we don't have to worry about it much.

148
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:33,450
We'll just have to make sure nobody
can barge in this time. We'll set a trap.

149
00:12:39,370 --> 00:12:42,370
Good morning, Ms. Balance.

150
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:45,410
I apologize for calling so early, Colonel.

151
00:12:45,410 --> 00:12:49,410
Oh, it's you. Did you have
something to tell me?

152
00:12:49,410 --> 00:12:50,620
Yes.

153
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:57,700
Yesterday, the JGDF counterintelligence
department's Section Three captured parasites.

154
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:03,830
We discovered one of them is a magician
formerly belonging to the USNA military.

155
00:13:03,830 --> 00:13:06,870
The parasites have begun moving again?

156
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:12,660
It's possible that after the parasites' vessels
were destroyed, they found new hosts.

157
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:15,700
Here are the ones
that have been captured.

158
00:13:16,990 --> 00:13:20,080
Three parasites have now
been taken prisoner.

159
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:24,740
This is the only one we've identified
thus far, but if you wish...

160
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:29,120
we can tell you where they are being held.

161
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:32,040
Please do, Ms. Kuroba.

162
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:33,950
Very well.

163
00:13:46,950 --> 00:13:48,620
That's about it.

164
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:52,290
I believe that airship belonged to the information
bureau's counterintelligence Section Three,

165
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:56,120
rumored to have ties to the Saegusa Family.

166
00:13:56,120 --> 00:14:00,450
If you're considering using the parasites
for military purposes, that would be dangerous.

167
00:14:00,450 --> 00:14:03,370
We don't know for sure
how to destroy them...

168
00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:06,290
so I think we should be sealing them.

169
00:14:06,290 --> 00:14:08,660
Counterintelligence Section Three?

170
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:11,160
Even I didn't know that,
despite being a member of the Saegusa family,

171
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:13,870
so I'm surprised you know about it.

172
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:18,620
I'd appreciate it if you didn't ask
what my information source is.

173
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:23,080
Well, you probably have a lot
of your own things going on, so I won't.

174
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,490
More importantly...

175
00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:28,330
why didn't you tell me
you were going out to capture the parasites?

176
00:14:28,330 --> 00:14:33,700
Because I figured bringing more people
along would make them cautious.

177
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:39,620
It does make sense, I guess.

178
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:45,830
Anyway, you want me to explain
this to my father, right?

179
00:14:45,830 --> 00:14:50,240
And get the information bureau to give back the
parasites they snatched to Erika and the others?

180
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:53,120
I won't tell you to get them
to give them back...

181
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:56,410
but once you've verified the reason
they took the parasites away,

182
00:14:56,410 --> 00:14:58,700
if they're trying to deal with them
in any other way than sealing them,

183
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:01,450
I'd like you to warn them off.

184
00:15:01,450 --> 00:15:03,040
Tell them that if the public finds out

185
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:05,080
that the information bureau is
taking advantage of the parasites

186
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:08,660
and magicians face
disadvantages because of it,

187
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:12,200
they'll be the ones
paying for the damages.

188
00:15:13,410 --> 00:15:15,490
That's a scary thought.

189
00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:21,200
Considering what's happening in the USNA,
I believe the threat is necessary.

190
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:26,160
Will do.

191
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,990
I'll talk to my father.

192
00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:32,830
But I can't promise any results,
so don't expect too much.

193
00:15:32,830 --> 00:15:38,410
Unlike Jumonji, I don't have
free reign over the Saegusa.

194
00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:40,040
Thank you.

195
00:15:40,910 --> 00:15:43,830
FEBRUARY 18, 2096

196
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:50,740
Saegusa...

197
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:56,580
MAYUMI SAEGUSA

198
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:56,580
CONFIRMATION

199
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:56,580
A spy holding facility belonging to
counterintelligence Section Three has been
attacked, and the captured parasites were killed.

200
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,870
This?

201
00:16:30,830 --> 00:16:32,490
Lina...

202
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:49,080
They make her do cruel things.

203
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:51,580
Brother, was that...

204
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:53,790
Lina?

205
00:16:53,790 --> 00:16:54,990
Probably.

206
00:16:56,540 --> 00:17:00,910
A homicidal act, clearly without any thought
given to the contents within.

207
00:17:00,910 --> 00:17:04,790
The goal was only to burn
the containers to cinders.

208
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:06,490
It had been an execution.

209
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:12,240
Assassinations are lonely
and cheerless work.

210
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:15,080
Without a high degree of affinity
personality-wise,

211
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:18,040
it's too heavy for a teenage girl.

212
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:20,120
So heavy she won't be able to endure.

213
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:23,410
It will crush her heart, little by little.

214
00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:25,490
And Lina doesn't have...

215
00:17:25,490 --> 00:17:28,080
the affinity to be an assassin.

216
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:36,080
Hello! Can you hear me?

217
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:41,950
It's okay, Miyuki. This room is free
of any sort of microphones or cameras.

218
00:17:41,950 --> 00:17:46,000
He's just talking at us.
We can't communicate.

219
00:17:43,450 --> 00:17:47,450
I'm going to assume you can,
if that's all right.

220
00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:49,790
I'll start with an introduction.

221
00:17:49,790 --> 00:17:53,290
My name is Raymond Sage Clark.

222
00:17:53,290 --> 00:17:55,790
One of the Seven Sages.

223
00:17:55,790 --> 00:17:57,620
The Seven Sages...

224
00:17:59,330 --> 00:18:02,370
I heard about you from Tia... or rather...

225
00:18:02,370 --> 00:18:04,540
Shizuku.

226
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:06,330
Pleased to meet you, Tatsuya!

227
00:18:06,330 --> 00:18:10,370
I see. He's Shizuku's information source.

228
00:18:10,370 --> 00:18:12,290
I'll cut to the chase.

229
00:18:12,290 --> 00:18:16,990
I'm the one who told Angie Sirius
about counterintelligence Section Three.

230
00:18:16,990 --> 00:18:22,240
Although it seems like she somehow
learned of this before I informed her.

231
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:26,410
And I also wanted to give you the scoop.

232
00:18:26,410 --> 00:18:30,490
I think you'll find it highly beneficial.

233
00:18:30,490 --> 00:18:34,240
The magician boycott movements
raging fiercely in the States right now,

234
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:37,910
the ones starting to gain traction in Japan,
were set up by one of the Seven Sages.

235
00:18:37,910 --> 00:18:40,450
Gide Sage Hague.

236
00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:41,950
What?

237
00:18:41,950 --> 00:18:45,580
Gide Hague... Also known as Gu Jie...
A stateless overseas Chinese person...

238
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:49,790
and supreme leader of the international
terrorist organization, Blanche...

239
00:18:49,790 --> 00:18:55,370
He's the boss of Hajime Tsukasa, whom you caught,
the leader of Blanche's Japanese branch.

240
00:18:55,370 --> 00:18:57,410
And also a senior member
of Richard Sun's group,

241
00:18:57,410 --> 00:19:02,540
the previous leader of the international
crime syndicate, No-Head Dragon.

242
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:07,950
In No-Head Dragon, they called Gu Jie
"the Black Elder" or "the Great Hague."

243
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:10,410
Oh, and just so you know,

244
00:19:10,410 --> 00:19:14,950
just because he's one of the Seven Sages
doesn't mean I'm in conspiracy with him.

245
00:19:14,950 --> 00:19:18,410
"Seven Sages" isn't the name
of a single group.

246
00:19:18,410 --> 00:19:23,330
It refers to the seven operators
with access privileges to Hlidskjalf.

247
00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:25,410
Hlidskjalf...

248
00:19:25,410 --> 00:19:28,410
I've heard a rumor about it once.

249
00:19:28,410 --> 00:19:30,700
Does it actually exist?

250
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:34,160
Hlidskjalf is one of the additional
expansion systems for Echelon III,

251
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:38,080
the global monitoring system.

252
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:41,080
Since it uses a backdoor in Echelon III,

253
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:46,450
maybe calling it a hacking system
lurking within the system would be better.

254
00:19:46,450 --> 00:19:50,490
Anyway, Hlidskjalf collects information
from throughout the world

255
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:54,830
and gives information
along with search matches to the operators.

256
00:19:54,830 --> 00:19:59,160
The system itself decides
who the operators will be,

257
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:02,620
and we haven't found any logic
to how it chooses people.

258
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:05,290
Ostensibly, it's completely random.

259
00:20:05,290 --> 00:20:06,580
This is insane.

260
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:12,040
And using Hlidskjalf
is a risk to the operators, too.

261
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:14,990
The operator's search history is saved.

262
00:20:14,990 --> 00:20:19,620
Search history records
are how I learned about Gide Hague.

263
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:25,040
Then, wouldn't Gide Hague now know
Raymond Clark's identity, too?

264
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:27,330
When Blanche's Japanese branch went under...

265
00:20:27,330 --> 00:20:30,740
and No-Head Dragon lost
its Japanese headquarters...

266
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:34,830
Hague lost all his ways
to influence Japan.

267
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:38,330
Hague was the one who set up
the parasites to come to Japan, too.

268
00:20:38,330 --> 00:20:44,740
His goal is to rebuild his spy base in Japan
by taking advantage of the chaos.

269
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:51,370
I've deciphered that his goal
is to destroy magic through social means.

270
00:20:51,370 --> 00:20:56,080
If he can get rid of it, the Great Asian Alliance,
which is behind the curve when it comes to magic,

271
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:59,450
will immediately see its military might
improve compared to Japan.

272
00:20:59,450 --> 00:21:02,490
To reign over a world without magic.

273
00:21:02,490 --> 00:21:06,620
I think that's what Hague
and the people behind him are after.

274
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:11,790
His logic has leaps in it,
but as a whole, it makes sense.

275
00:21:11,790 --> 00:21:15,120
And that isn't what I want.

276
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:17,620
You can laugh at me,
because this is going to seem romantic,

277
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:21,870
but I think magic is a way
toward a reformation of humankind.

278
00:21:23,330 --> 00:21:29,740
Anyway, I'd like to keep providing you
with necessary information in the future.

279
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:34,240
Tatsuya Shiba, the Strategic-Class magician,
Shiva the Destroyer.

280
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:36,660
That's a terrible nickname.

281
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:39,620
Sorry, this all got a little long-winded.

282
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:45,910
Basically, I'm proposing
to help you get rid of the parasites.

283
00:21:45,910 --> 00:21:49,990
Tomorrow night,
February nineteenth by you,

284
00:21:49,990 --> 00:21:55,990
lure all active parasites to the outdoor
training area behind First High.

285
00:21:55,990 --> 00:21:59,410
Then, I want you to annihilate them.

286
00:22:00,790 --> 00:22:04,950
And I've already given Angie Sirius
this information, too.

287
00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:09,330
You can cooperate with her
or compete with her, whatever you prefer.

288
00:22:19,950 --> 00:22:23,410
We'll be late unless we leave soon.

289
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:52,080
VISITOR ARC X
